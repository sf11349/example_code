In public health, data can be expected from verity of sources. So, in any analysis, two additional factors warrant careful consideration:
Firstly, the process of data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and curation is crucial to supporting analytical concerns. This involves addressing issues such as missing data, removing outliers, and synchronising units of measure between variables.
